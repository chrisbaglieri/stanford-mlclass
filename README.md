Stanford's Machine Learning Course
==================================

This is a collection of hacks and assignments from Stanford's online Machine Learning course. While I was hoping to do the assignments using NumPy, the course embraced Octave and I figured diving deeper into machine learning while going with the grain was the more pragmatic thing to do. In the future, I'd like to revisit the assignments and see if I can port them over to either Ruby or Python.

Also, if you'd like to following along at home, check out [the course website](http://www.ml-class.org) and [Octave](http://www.ml-class.org/course/resources/index?page=octave-install).
